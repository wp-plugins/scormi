Scores your blog post engagement strength.

== Description ==
Scormi uses your Google Analytics data and some math to calculate a blog post engagement score. Knowing this can help you shape your content for better user engagement. Scores are computed for your top 10 posts by traffic and presented in a scorecard-like green, amber, red display for you to instantly see how well they are perfroming relative to the group. Scormi also reports Google Analytics metrics applicable to your site in general.

Use a shortcode to view the report on a publicly accessible (protected) WordPress page or view it in the WP admin. 

Report metrics include:

* Sessions & corresponding last year sessions
* Year over Year traffic growth % 
* Return visits %
* Top 10 pages with Sessions, Bounce Rate, Average Time on Page, Quality score.
* Top 3 countries
* Traffic source by Organic, Direct, Referral, Social
* Top traffic sources by domain (who is driving traffic to your site)
* Top social media traffic sources and number of sessions (your footprint)

= How it Works =
After you authenticate with Google Analytics the plugin requests your information once per night. The request is sent to our server, which connects to GA via API, gathers the info, does the quality score calculations, renders an HTML report, and returns it to the plugin. The report is cached in WordPress between updates for quick loading. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= For whom is this plugin intended ? =
For WordPress blogs with at least 100 visitors per day and one year of data history.

= Can Scormi see my Google credentials? =
No. You sign into Google using their OAuth 2 secure login and Google Analytics gives you an access token for Scormi to use.

= The report doesnâ€™t look right on a smartphone. = 
The report uses Bootstrap 3 and has been built to work correctly with the standard WordPress theme. Using a 3rd party theme that is not mobile responsive or has CSS idiosyncrasies can cause formatting issues on small screens.

= What's the math behind the quality scorecard? =
See Blog Post Quality Scorecard at Scromi.net for the details.

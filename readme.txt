Your top Google Analytics metrics and Moz SEO footprint every day, automatically.

== Description ==
A time saving automation tool for digital marketers, Scormi creates a daily, sharable web analytics report from your Google Analytics and Moz information. The plugin uses APIs to connect to Google Analytics and Moz, then generates an HTML report that can be automatically emailed to you or can be viewed in the WordPress admin at any time.

The report contains Google Analytics information and Mozscape information from the current update. Choose report date ranges of the past 7, 30, 60, or 90 days. Report metrics include:

* Visitors & Unique Pageviews
* Top 10 Landing pages with associated Users, Pageviews, New vs Returning, & Bounce rate
* Desktop, Tablet, Mobile breakdown
* Visitor Top 3 countries
* Traffic sources: Organic, Direct, Referral, Social
* Your siteâ€™s MozRank, Domain Authority, and the number of equity links (back links) to your site.

= How it Works =
The plugin requests your Google Analytics and Moz information once per night via API to these services. It then renders an HTML report  that can be set to auto-email to you and/or is always viewable in the WordPress admin. The report provides a high-level snapshot and is fully automatic; there are no user settings to configure. The report is cached in WordPress between updates for quick loading.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can Scormi see my Google credentials? =
No. You sign into Google using their OAuth 2 secure login and Google Analytics gives you an access token for Scormi to use.

= What is Moz(scape)? =
Moz is a company that collects and provides website and web page popularity information--an "SEO footprint." Mozscape is their database of this information, which is publicly available; no user credentials or setup is required. The information on the Scormi report is helpful in tracking your SEO strength.
